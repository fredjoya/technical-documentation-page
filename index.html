                <p>React is a library for building user interfaces. React is not a framework – it's not even exclusive
                    to the web. It's
                    used with other libraries to render to certain environments. For instance, React Native can be used
                    to build mobile
                    applications.</p>
                <p>React's primary goal is to minimize the bugs that occur when developers are building UIs. It does
                    this through the use
                    of components — self-contained, logical pieces of code that describe a portion of the user
                    interface. These components
                    can be composed together to create a full UI, and React abstracts away much of the rendering work,
                    leaving you to
                    concentrate on the UI design.</p>

                    In order to use create-react-app, you need to have Node.js installed. It's recommended that you use
                    the long-term support
                    (LTS) version. Node includes npm (the node package manager), and npx (the node package runner).

            <article>
                <p>create-react-app takes one argument: the name you'd like to give your app. create-react-app uses this name to make a new
                directory, then creates the necessary files inside it. Make sure you cd to the place you'd like your app to live on your
                hard drive, then run the following in your terminal:
                </p>
                <code>npx create-react-app moz-todo-react --use-npm</code>
               <p>
                When the process is complete, cd into the moz-todo-react directory and run the command npm start. The scripts installed
                by create-react-app will start being served at a local server at localhost:3000, and open the app in a new browser tab.
                Your browser will display something like this:
               </p>

            <header>Exploring our first React component</header>
            <article>
                <p>In React, a <strong>component</strong> is a reusable module that renders a part of our app. These parts can be big or small, but they are
                usually clearly defined: they serve a single, obvious purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's open src/App.js, since our browser is prompting us to edit it. This file contains our first component, App, and a
                    few other lines of code:
                </p>
                <code>
                import React from 'react';
                import logo from './logo.svg';
                import './App.css';
                
                function App() {
                return (
                &lt;div className="App"&gt;
                    &lt;header className="App-header"&gt;
                        &lt;img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" /&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;
                            Edit &lt;code&gt;src/App.js&lt;/code&gt;and save to reload.
                        &lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;a className="App-link" href="https://reactjs.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;
                            Learn React
                        &lt;/a&gt;
                    &lt;/header&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
                );
                }
                export default App;
                </code>

                <p>The App.js file consists of three main parts: some import statements at the top, the App component in the middle, and an
                export statement at the bottom. Most React components follow this pattern.
                </p>
            </article>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="importStatements">
            <header>Import statements</header>
            <article>
                <p>The import statements at the top of the file allow App.js to use code that has been defined elsewhere. Let's look at
                these statements more closely.
                </p>
                <code>
                import React from 'react';
                import logo from './logo.svg';
                import './App.css';
                </code>
                <p>
                    The first statement imports the React library itself. Because React turns the JSX we write into React.createElement(),
                    all React components must import the React module. If you skip this step, your application will produce an error.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second statement imports a logo from './logo.svg'. Note the use of ./ at the beginning of the path, and the .svg
                extension at the end — these tell us that the file is local and that it is not a JavaScript file. Indeed, the logo.svg
                file lives in our source directory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We don't write a path or extension when importing the React module — this is not a local file; instead, it is listed as a dependency in our package.json file. Be careful of this distinction as you work through this lesson!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The third statement imports the CSS related to our App component. Note that there is no variable name and no from
                    directive. This particular import syntax is not native to JavaScript module syntax — it comes from Webpack, the tool
                    create-react-app uses to bundle all our JavaScript files together and serve them to the browser.
                </p>
            </article>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="appComp">
            <header>The App Component</header>
            <article>
                <p>After the imports, we have a function named App. Whereas most of the JavaScript community prefers camel-case names like
                helloWorld, React components use pascal-case variable names, like HelloWorld, to make it clear that a given JSX element
                is a React component, and not a regular HTML tag. If you were to rename the App function to app, your browser would show
                you an error.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's look at App more closely.
                </p>
                <code>
                    function App() {
                    return (
                    &lt;div className="App"&gt;
                        &lt;header className="App-header"&gt;
                            &lt;img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" /&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;
                                Edit &lt;code&gt;src/App.js&lt;/code&gt; and save to reload.
                            &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;a className="App-link" href="https://reactjs.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;
                                Learn React
                            &lt;/a>
                        &lt;/header>
                    &lt;/div>
                    );
                    }
                </code>
                <p>
                    The App function returns a JSX expression. This expression defines what your browser ultimately renders to the DOM.

        <section class="main-section" id="exportStatements">
            <header>Export statements</header>
            <article>
                <p>At the very bottom of the App.js file, the statement export default App makes our App component available to other
                modules.
                </p>
            </article>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="compProps">
            <header>Component props</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    A <strong>prop</strong> is any data passed into a React component. React props are comparable to HTML attributes. Where HTML elements
                    have attributes, React components have props. Props are written inside component calls, and use the same syntax as HTML
                    attributes — prop="value". In React, dataflow is unidirectional: props can only be passed from Parent components down to
                    Child components; and props are read-only.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let’s open index.js and give our
                    "App" call its first prop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Add a prop of subject to the
                    "App" component call, with a value of Clarice. When you are done, your code should look something like this:
                </p>

                <code>
                    ReactDOM.render(
                    &lt;App subject="Clarice" /&gt;, document.getElementById('root'));
                </code>
                <p>
                    Back in App.js, let's revisit the App function itself, which reads like this (with the return statement shortened for
                    brevity):
                </p>
                <code>function App() {
                const subject = "React";
                return (
                // return statement
                );
                }
                </code>
                <p> Change the signature of the App function so that it accepts props as a parameter, and delete the subject const. Just
                like any other function parameter, you can put props in a console.log() to print it to your browser's console. Go ahead
                and do that before the return statement, like so:
            </p>
            <code>
                function App(props) {
                console.log(props);
                return (
                // return statement
                );
                }
            </code>
            <p>
                Save your file and check your browser's JavaScript console. You should see something like this logged:
            </p>
            <code>
                Object { subject: "Clarice" }
            </code>
            <p>
                The object property subject corresponds to the subject prop we added to our
                "App" component call, and the string Clarice corresponds to its value. Component props in React are always collected
                into objects in this fashion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that subject is one of our props, let's utilize it in App.js. Change the subject constant so that, instead of
                defining it as the string React, you are reading the value of props.subject. You can also delete your console.log() if
                you want.
            </p>
            <code>
                function App(props) {
                const subject = props.subject;
                return (
                // return statement
                );
                }
            </code>
            <p>
                When you save, the app should now greet you with "Hello, Clarice!". If you return to index.js, edit the value of
                subject, and save, your text will change.
            </p>

                    This brings us to the end of our initial look at React, including how to install it locally, creating a starter app, and
                    how the basics work. In the next article, we'll start building our first proper application — a todo list. Before we do
                    that, however, let's recap some of the things we’ve learned.
                    
                    In React:
                    <li>Components can import modules they need and must export themselves at the bottom of their files.</li>
                    <li>Component functions are named with PascalCase.</li>
                    <li>You can read JSX variables by putting them between curly braces, like {so}.</li>
                    <li>Props are written just like attributes inside component calls and are passed into components.</li>
                </p>
